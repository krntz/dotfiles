engaged with more\n\t- In tense situations, vulnerable statements from a robot cause human team members to exhibit more vulnerable behaviour\n\t\t- Teammates explained their failures, consoled teammates who made mistakes, and laughed more together\n\t- Defines trust as \"willingness to take risks by making oneself vulnerable to the responses of others\"\n\t\t- Trust can be promoted by expressing vulnerability\n\t\t\t- Vulnerability seems to be reciprocal: If one person expresses vulnerability, other parties are more likely to self-disclose\n\t\t\t\t- A single team member can thus affect the mental state and trust behaviour of others in the team\n\t\t\t\t\t- Known as [[Barsade's Ripple Effect]]\n\t\t\t- This seems to extend to robots as well\n\t- Vulnerable behaviour expression

teams are characterized by high levels of trust between team members, allowing the team to learn from mistakes, take risks, and entertain diverse ideas. We investigated a robot’s potential to shape trust within a team through the robot’s expressions of vulnerability. We conducted a between-subjects experiment (N = 35 teams, 105 participants) comparing the behavior of three human teammates collaborating with either a social robot making vulnerable statements or with a social robot making neutral statements. We found that, in a group with a robot making vulnerable statements, participants responded more to the robot’s comments and directed more of their gaze to the robot, displaying a higher level of engagement with the robot. Additionally, we discovered that during times of tension, human teammates in a group with a robot making vulnerable statements were more likely to explain their failure to the group, console team members who had made mistakes, and laugh together, all actions that reduce the amount of tension experienced by the team.

We conducted a between-subjects experiment (N = 35 teams, 105 participants) comparing the behavior of three human teammates collaborating with either a social robot making vulnerable statements or with a social robot making neutral statements. We found that, in a group with a robot making vulnerable statements, participants responded more to the robot’s comments and directed more of their gaze to the robot, displaying a higher level of engagement with the robot. Additionally, we discovered that during times of tension, human teammates in a group with a robot making vulnerable statements were more likely to explain their failure to the group, console team members who had made mistakes, and laugh together, all actions that reduce the amount of tension experienced by the team. These results suggest that a robot’s vulnerable behavior can have “ripple effects” on their human team members’ expressions of trust-related behavior.\n- [[Attachments]]\n\t- [Strohkorb Sebo et al. -

the same results?\n- [[Research Question]]\n\t- Can't be an educated guess\n\t\t- Should be based on gaps/issues in literature\n\t- Can't be too vague\n\t\t- \"Is A better than B?\"\n- Formulating a hypothesis\n\t- Scenario\n\t- Variable\n\t\t- Any characteristic, number, or quantity that can be measured or counted\n\t\t- Numeric variables\n\t\t\t- Continuous\n\t\t\t- Discrete/Count\n\t\t- Categorical variables\n\t\t\t- Logistic/binary (e.g. did people reveal a secret to the robot or not?)\n\t\t\t- Ordinal ([[Likert Scale]])\n\t\t\t- Nominal (e.g. type of robot people interacted with)\n- Think of manipulation as a variable\n\t- [[independent variable]] - The thing you believe will have an impact\n- [[dependent variable]] -  (hopefully) changes in response to the [[independent variable]]\n- Manipulation must be compared to something\n\t- Treatment vs. control\n\t- Condition 1 vs. condition 2\n- Between group design\n\t- independent measures\n\t- Each participant only experiences 1 level of manipulation\n\t\t- E.g. only treatment or control, never both\n- Within group design\n\t- Repeated measures\n\t- Each participant all manipulations\n\t\t- E.g. condition 1 AND condition 2\n\t- Needs to be counterbalanced\n\t\t- Half should experience condition 1 -> condition 2, and the other half should experience condition 2 -> condition 1\n\t\t- Should be done randomly\n- Practical tools for HRI\n\t- Explicit (subjective) measures - Conscious impression that people have time to reflect on; Ask people explicitly (e.g. \"Do you trust this robot?\")\n\t\t- Questionnaires\n\t\t- Interviews\n\t\t- Informal brainstorming\n\t- Implicit (objective) measures - Unconscious attitudes\n\t\t- Reaction times\n\t\t- Behaviour\n\t\t- Engagement\n\t- Important to have multiple, valid, measures\n\t\t- The robot is not the only thing affecting people\n\t- Attitudes don't always match behaviour\n\t- [[RoSAS]]\n\t\t- Well established\n\t- [[NARS]]\n\t- [[Proxemics]] - Distance people keep to the robot\n- Demographic data should be collected\n\t- Gender\n\t\t- Male\n\t\t- Female\n\t\t- Non-binary\n\t\t- Prefer not to say\n- Group activity\n\t- Is abusing a robotic agent seen as more morally acceptable than abusing a human?\n- Types of statistics\n\t- Descriptive statistics\n\t\t- Describes your population/sample\n\t\t- Organise, summarise, simplify, present\n\t- Inferential statistics\n\t\t- Frequentist\n\t\t- Bayesian\n\t\t- Makes predictions\n\t\t\t- Generalises from samples to populations\n\t\t\t- Hypothesis testing\n\t\t\t-

humans. Besides avoiding unwanted or harmful contact, people should also perceive the drone as safe. Existing safe motion planning approaches for autonomous robots, such as drones, have primarily focused on ensuring physical safety, e.g., by imposing constraints on motion planners. However, studies indicate that ensuring physical safety does not necessarily lead to perceived safety. Prior work in Human-Drone Interaction (HDI) shows that factors such as the drone's speed and distance to the human are important for perceived safety.

Besides avoiding unwanted or harmful contact, people should also perceive the drone as safe. Existing safe motion planning approaches for autonomous robots, such as drones, have primarily focused on ensuring physical safety, e.g., by imposing constraints on motion planners. However, studies indicate that ensuring physical safety does not necessarily lead to perceived safety. Prior work in Human-Drone Interaction (HDI) shows that factors such as the drone's speed and distance to the human are important for perceived safety. Building on these works, we propose a parameterized control barrier function (CBF) that constrains the drone's maximum deceleration and minimum distance to the human and update its parameters on people's ratings of perceived safety. We describe an implementation and evaluation of our approach. Results of a within-subject user study (N=15) show that we can improve perceived safety of a drone by adjusting to people individually.\n- [[Attachments]]\n\t- [van Waveren et al. - 2023 - Increasing

different size\n\t\t\t\t- The smaller the hexagon, the higher the reward\n\t\t\t- Depending on the condition, the drone may malfunction, with an error on the tablet\n\t\t\t- They saw decreased trust, but not the expected effect on risk-taking behaviour\n\t\t- The new project\n\t\t\t- Fix some of the issues raised by reviewers\n\t\t\t- More explanations of the malfunctions\n\t\t\t- Technical improvements\n\t\t\t\t- Continuous movement\n\t\t\t\t\t- Would require bounding box to prevent participants from flying into walls/themselves\n\t\t\t- Add time limit to attempt to encourage more risk-taking\n\t\t\t- Another potential avenue is to implement different behaviours\n\t\t\t\t- Rebecca is worried about the fidelity of the movements of the drone\n\t\t\t\t- Maybe involve [[People/Joe
